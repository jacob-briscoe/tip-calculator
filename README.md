# Overview
Simple app to calculate a tip. I initially created it based on an example application I was following in this training program: [Functional Programming for Beginners with JavaScript](https://www.knowthen.com/functional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript), provided by [KnowThen](https://www.knowthen.com/) all credit goes to [James Moore](https://github.com/knowthen) for the inspiration.
